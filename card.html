			<p class="description">Peacocks are omnivorous birds that belong to the pheasant family. While they are beautiful and ornate, they are all males. The vibrant train of a peacock reaches 60 inches in length. Each of its tail feathers are tipped with an iridescent eyespot that have a blue and bronze ring. The quality of a peacock's train is critical to selection by a peahen during mating season. </p>
